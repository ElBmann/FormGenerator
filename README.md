## FormGenerator

This project was created to help clients with creating their orders, Po Imports, and Items for the company web portal.

### The problem:
<li>No validation clients are creating long SKU numbers, PONumbers, and Order Numbers</li>
<li>adding commas(which disrupts the import process)</li> 
<li>certain clients don't have excel or struggle with templates</li>
<li>Clients create there own fields which causes imports to fail</li>
<li>Clients lose or misplace excel sheets</li>
<li>Support team spends 3 hours a day updating and fixing templates</li>
  
## This project uses:

<li>bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)</li>
<li>React Strap: (https://reactstrap.github.io/)</li>
<li>react-csv: (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-csv)</li>
